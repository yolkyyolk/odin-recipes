    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A delicious Japanese noodle soup dish, usually made with wheat noodles in a flavored broth. Seasoned with soysauce, and topped with ingredients of your choice. Personal favorites include pork, seaweed, bean sprouts, and green onion. Highly customizable.</p>
    <p>We are going for the minimalist version here, so if you want to get fancy, look elsewhere.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ramen noodles: can be fresh, or maybe you want to spice up a package of Maruchan/Top Ramen.</li>
        <li>Broth</li>
        <li>Miso or soysauce</li>
        <li>Protein: both pork and tofu are tasty options.</li>
        <li>Seasame oil</li>
        <li>Toppings: bean sprouts, green onion, egg, seawood, or whatever garnish you would enjoy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce/use broth of choice: usually involves mixing broth flavor, such as beef or a flavor packet, with water.</li>
        <li>Saute any added (optional) veggie toppings. If adding pork or egg, have cooked and ready to throw in after veggies are cooked.</li>
        <li>Combine flavors: add soysauce if using, red pepper flakes, seasame oil, or a little brown sugar for a bit of sweetness. Experiment.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked noodles to the sauce pan, along with any prepared proteins.</li>
        <li>Add garnish, such as green onion or bean sprouts.</li>
